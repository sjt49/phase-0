<article><h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>

The benefits of using version control are numerous. Version Control Systems allow multiple people to manage and share files. It allows developers to archive versions. It Maintains historical information to compare versions, and Enables collaboration.

How does git help you keep track of changes?

Git is an open-source version control system that allows developers to track changes made on their code files throughout the lifetime of a project. Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux who wanted a better way to track changes in software development. Git helps you to track changes with 3 stages: Committed, Modified, and Staged.

Why use GitHub to store your code?

Using GitHub to store code is very helpful because GitHub conveniently functions as a Version Control Software in my Butt. Files can be direcly collaborated on in real time by multiple users.

<article><h3>Thinking About Time</h3>I researched techniques to get into the ‘zone’, which turned out to be a very different strategy than time boxing. While time boxing seems like a science to build your work endurance, getting in the zone is an art that balances the challenge at hand and your skill level, along with external environment and internal concentration. It is very important that the work is engaging to be in the zone, but shouldn’t be beyond the scope of your capabilities. If it is too easy it will be boring, and to fight this you should add extra challenges like a time limit to make it engaging. Having a clear goal to work towards will jump start your flow much more than a boring task you might just trudge through. If it’s too difficult a task on the other hand, you will get stuck and not get any feedback on your work. Receiving immediate feedback on your efforts is one of the keys to being in the zone and keeping you engaged, learning from your errors, feeling good from your successes, and not knowing which will come next as you try your hardest. If you aren’t making any headway with a challenging problems, seek help to bring the problem into your level of achievability. I also found out that possibly the most crucial element to getting into the zone is to know your own internal rhythm. I’m not a morning person, so trying to work right after waking up would not be conducive to getting in the zone. Being really self aware to the way you uniquely operate is the real key to finding your zone, because everybody’s zone is different. Over the next week or so, I’ll be taking notes as to times, tasks, meals, etc that make me feel more/less productive, and working out times or schedules as to when I’m most able to get in the zone.
