##Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Hello! Log into your GitHub account and click the + icon in the upper right hand corner of the page. A dropdown menu will appear, so select 'new repository' to continue. The first thing you will do is name your repo; be descriptive but concise, i.e. my-website. Don't change the owner, that's you! Unless you have reason not to, keep the Public option selected. You can also initialize with a readme, and choose a liscencing for your code. Unless you're looking to sell your software, choose something like MIT liscencing. Now click create repository and your on your way! Now you can see your repository. In the space next to HTTPS there will be a link: copy the whole address.
Now it's time to switch gears from your online GitHub account and move into the command line. On Mac it should be called Terminal, Windows would be PowerShell. Once your in the command line, navigate to the folder you want to copy your new repository into. Now use the command git clone URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED and hit enter. The repo on GitHub will download and now you've got in on your laptop as well!


##Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the source code is availible as well as the software product. This is important, because then users can add features, fix bugs, adjust the layout, and much more, all on their own. If they have coding skills. This also means that the original developers lose their ability to really sell the product. If the code is availible to the public, then anyone can download it and run it. That doesn't mean they give up the copyright however. Liscencing lets the public use, change, and distribute the code at various levels without necessarily making it public domain.


##What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think that open source is definitely the way to go, quite possibly utopia. At least in terms of what's best for code quality, and essentially what's best for the consumer. The benefit of selling the software is that you get money to fuel it's developement. You can pay people to care about and work on the code. You have the stability (hopefully) as a company that you will be around a while, be able to work and update the software, and in addition the freedom to branch out into different software because you're getting paid. All of this is good for software, I mean computer software may have not gotten off the ground if no one at the beginning was being paid to write it. But open source projects have their own unique benefits as well.
I think the best ideas come from the people who would do them for free, who have enough passion to turn an idea into a reality. And by making code open source, you're casting the biggest net for your code to find those people. The feature that revolutionizes your software might be in the brain of one of your employees, but if it's a 1 in a million idea, that person is  probably not in your office. So yeah, that's my rant, but I think that users are going to benefit more from passionate people adding to projects they care about more than developers looking to sell their product. Because the former is trying to make the best code, while the latter unfortunately will only find success if they can get people to buy it.


##Assess the importance of using licenses.

Liscencing is a good open source policy that allows the public to view and work on your code, without giving up all credit as the original creator. If the options were copywrite or public domain only, there would probably be a lot less open source projects today. There are different kinds/levels of liscencing that describe how the public can change or distribute your source code, but overall the ones I've seen are mostly pretty liberal. If you're giving up your source code, you probably won't be making much (or any) money off of it.

##What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I've now gotten a pretty good hang of updating files/repos on GitHub via pushing my changes from the command line. Actually I realized during this challenge that I had mistakenly made my files .mb and not .md. I don't know how I was getting it to work before! Anyway I used mv in the command line to rename all my text files, and then added, committed, and pushed. It only took me a couple minutes to fix the mistakes from all the previous challenges, I felt proud. It was also cool to see the tiny website of my own.

##Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Not particularly, but all of the resources in the curriculum have been extremely informative thusfar.
