# 1.1 Thinking About Time
I researched techniques to get into the ‘zone’, which turned out to be a very different strategy than time boxing. While time boxing seems like a science to build your work endurance, getting in the zone is an art that balances the challenge at hand and your skill level, along with external environment and internal concentration. It is very important that the work is engaging to be in the zone, but shouldn’t be beyond the scope of your capabilities. If it is too easy it will be boring, and to fight this you should add extra challenges like a time limit to make it engaging. Having a clear goal to work towards will jump start your flow much more than a boring task you might just trudge through. If it’s too difficult a task on the other hand, you will get stuck and not get any feedback on your work. Receiving immediate feedback on your efforts is one of the keys to being in the zone and keeping you engaged, learning from your errors, feeling good from your successes, and not knowing which will come next as you try your hardest. If you aren’t making any headway with a challenging problems, seek help to bring the problem into your level of achievability. I also found out that possibly the most crucial element to getting into the zone is to know your own internal rhythm. I’m not a morning person, so trying to work right after waking up would not be conducive to getting in the zone. Being really self aware to the way you uniquely operate is the real key to finding your zone, because everybody’s zone is different. Over the next week or so, I’ll be taking notes as to times, tasks, meals, etc that make me feel more/less productive, and working out times or schedules as to when I’m most able to get in the zone.



Ideally I’d like to work in the zone 100% of the time; characterized by maximum output and hours of working just melting away, sign me up! But it’s much easier to stay in the zone than to get in the zone, and when you can’t, it’s like writer’s block. It just isn’t going to happen. Time boxing and the pomodoro technique is for times like these. Or rather, if you utilize them daily, those techniques will be immensely helpful during those times. Instead of maximizing your output, you maximize small increments of time. By using 25 minutes to the fullest, you build internal concentration and naturally learn strategies to utilize that short time to the fullest. Like lifting weights, if you are consistent with this approach, you will notice your stamina increase on it’s own.



For me, I think that it’s best to use these two strategies in tandem. While the zone is awesome and feels great when your in it, it is not totally reliable and can be difficult to achieve. It should take a lot of time, meditation, and self awareness for me to become a real master at finding the best ways, times, and states of mind to get into my zone. The pomodoro technique on the other hand is something I can do every day, and see the results every week. There’s work to do everyday for DBC, so I think this is the most reliable method to bring with me to each challenge every day.

## 1.2 The Command Line
A shell is what a user talks to that then talks to the operating system. The interface can be graphical or text based, but it is the next layer of abstraction above the OS. Bash is an example of a command line shell. It is text based, and stems from shells written by the 'masters' who didn't have monitors using limited computers.

The most challenging thing for me during this exercise was to actually make myself type in each command multiple times even when I felt like I knew it the first time. I felt like I had a good correlation from the beginning between the command line and the GUI layout I'm familiar with so a lot seemed redundant. However I'm glad I did write everything out and experimented with the do more sections because I didn't quite understand everything like I thought I did. Especially pushd and popd didn't work as I expected when I started to use them a little more. Eventually I was able to use all the commands and get the results I was expecting with them, after practice.

I think the most important commands are ls and cd, because if you don't know where you are in the system, or if you can't move around, then you can't really do anything. Next I would say man/help would be the most important, because if you know how to use that then you can use anything really.

pwd- print working directory. shows what directory/folder you're in.

ls- lists all the files / folders in the directory you're in.

mv- renames a file or directory

cd- lets you change the directory you're in.

../- in conjuction with cd, moves you backward/upward a directory for each ../

touch- makes an empty file and gives it a name

mkdir- creates a directory

less- lets you page through a text file

rmdir- deletes an empty directory

rm- deletes a file

help/man- gives you information about a function from the api

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning
Hello new person looking for information on GitHub repositories! The first rule of thumb you should know when creating with/forking repositories is that you should first get them into your GitHub account, and then next clone them to your computer. Okay, so to get started, ask yourself this: do I want to start from scratch, or can I piggyback off of something that someone else has already done? If the answer is the latter, then forking is for you! All you have to do is find that repository you want to build off of on GitHub, click the fork button in the upper right hand corner, choose your profile, and boom your done. However, if you're starting from scratch, it's just as easy. Click the plus sign in the upper right hand corner, give your repository a name, and boom, done again.

Now, to get these repositories off the internet and onto your computer, you must open terminal. After navigating to the directory you want to have your repository in, simply use the command git clone REPOSITORY_URL_HERE, wait a few seconds, and your repository will be downloaded to your computer. Congratulations, you are now free to edit these documents from your computer.

Honestly I was a little surprised how easy it was to fork and clone with GitHub and the terminal. I guess that's why people love it!
